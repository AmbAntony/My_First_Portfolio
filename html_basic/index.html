        <p>
            <strong>Back</strong> in 2012, I decided to try my hand at creating custom Tumblr themes and tumbled </br>
            head first into the rabbit hole of coding and web development. Fast-forward to today, and Ive had the</br> 
            privilege of building software for an advertising agency, a start-up, a huge corporation, and a digital product studio.</br>
        </p>
        <p>
            My main focus these days is building accessible user interfaces for our customers at Klaviyo. </br>
            I most enjoy building software in the sweet spot where design and engineering meet </br>
            things that look good but are also built well under the hood. </br>

        </p>
        <p>
            In my free time, I release online video course that covers everything you need </br>
            to know to build a web app with the Spotify API. </br>

            I also collect <a href="\C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop\ALX Repo\My_First_Portfolio\html_basic\tweets.html">historical notes</a> as part of my videos and photos collection. 
        </p>
        <p>
            When Im not at the computer, Im usually rock climbing, reading, hanging out with my wife and two cats, or running </br>
            around Hyrule searching for Korok seed.
